											<h2>Node Reputation</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The NEM network is the first platform to use a node reputation management system. 
										It is enabled via Eigentrust++, a security clustering algorithm that allows nodes to give reputation 
										to their neighbors. This makes it very difficult for a node to give false information consistently 
										to the network. Only nodes that have regularly performed well in the past giving verifiable correct 
										information are given a good reputation and have their data acknowledged.</p>

											<h2>Spam Protection</h2>
										</header>
										<p>NEM uses localized spam protection. It is activated after all blocks have reached full capacity and 
										only the accounts producing spam are affected. The spamming accounts have their transactions fees increasingly 
										raised in relation to the spam they produce. They therefore can still spam, but it increasingly costs more in 
										proportion to their spam volume. At the same time normal accounts in the network keep their low transaction costs.</p>

											<h2>Two Tiered Design</h2>
										</header>
										<p>NEMâ€™s platform was designed as a two-tier solution. The NCC, light, and mobile wallets are the client or wallet 
										tier and the NIS is the server tier. Not only does the NIS have a full set of API's but the NCC also has a webserver 
										with powerful API's. These two layers create a firewall of security in between the wallet where all important information 
										is stored and signed, and the node that announces transactions.</p>

											<h2>Supernodes Program</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The NEM Supernode Program gives awards to high performance and stable nodes on the NEM network. To run a supernode a person 
										must have at least 3,000,000 XEM assigned as a delegated account booting that node and pass regular performance checks. These 
										nodes help support the network and ensure it can process large amounts of data and reliably service mobile and light wallets.</p>

											<h2>Lightwallet</h2>
										</header>
										<p>NEM has three versions of wallets that can be run locally and independently of an NIS. The NCC is the first wallet and 
										comes equipped with APIs. Open-source Android and iOS mobile apps have been built and are released on the testnet for full 
										testing and will be coming to the App Store and the Google Play store soon. And lastly there is the new lightwallet. </p>
