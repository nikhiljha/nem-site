											<h2>Multisignature Contracts</h2>
										</header>
										<p>NEM's multisig solution is the first “on blockchain”. This doesn’t sound like a big deal at first, 
										but if one really takes a closer look at it, the advantages are significant. With other platforms, 
										multisig has always been client or wallet based which means each implementation is not compatible 
										across many different platforms, even if it is of the same crypto currency. NEM’s multisig can work with 
										APIs and any wallet or app connecting to the NEM chain. This even enables blockchain pushed notifications 
										announcing transactions to the wallets to sign. </p><p><br>
										NEM’s version of multisig doesn’t make new accounts for a multisig address by combining keys, instead it 
										makes a contract that assigns rights and powers of a certain account to other accounts. This form of 
										multi-user accounts can make any form of M of N with ease and can also have the M or the N edited just as 
										easily by simply just updating the contract on the blockchain. And since the NEM’s multisig contracts can 
										be edited as many times as a person likes, either adding or subtracting people as needed, it is not only 
										good for securing funds, but also makes for a good foundation for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).</p>

											<h2>Namespaces</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Namespaces on the NEM system is a domain naming system, not unlike that of the internet. There are higher 
										level domains and subdomains. This allows one person with one domain to create many different subdomains for 
										their different projects or outside business accounts. It also helps to build and maintain a reputation system for Mosaics.</p><br>
										<p>A creator owning the root domain namespace can create as many sub-domains as wanted using a convention similar to the Java 
										namespace convention, i.e., separated by a dot \".\" to represent a domain or subdomain and a colon \":\" to represent the name 
										of an asset. This gives the creator a practically limitless number of mosaics that can be defined within a practically limitless 
										number of sub-domains.</p><br>
										<p>The sub-levels of a namespace can act as the actual name of the asset, or in some cases can be a class of assets as it is 
										itself a sub-domain with lots of assets under that sub-domain name. This means that last part of a string will always be the 
										name of the individual asset on the NEM blockchain and the prior names will act as the domain and/or subdomain for that asset. </p>

											<h2>Harvesting</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In NEM harvesting is the act of forming blocks (mining/forging). A harvester must have at least 10,000 vested XEM in his/her 
										account and be running a booted and synchronized node. Once a block is formed by that harvester, a new block is added to the chain 
										and all the fees collected from that block will be delivered to the harvester’s account.</p><br>
										<p>NEM has additionally enabled a feature called delegated harvesting. This is when a person is able to request other people to 
										form blocks and process fees for them, but done in a safe and secure way so that a person’s funds are not ever locked up, and fees 
										are always given directly to the person that activated delegated harvesting, not the person that was harvesting for them. </p>

											<h2>Messaging</h2>

										<p>Messages can be sent along with XEM transactions or by themselves. This can be done in unencrypted/encrypted/hex formats depending 
										on the user or programmer’s needs.</p>

											<h2>Mosaics</h2>
										</header>
										<p>NEM’s asset feature is called Mosaics. The mosaics themselves are customizable by amount in either a fixed capped or mutable quantity. 
										They can be designed to be transferable or not, divisible or not, have personalized descriptions, and can be sent alongside encrypted 
										messages in one transaction. Mosaics can be applied with a levy so that any mosaic being sent on the network will have to have a special 
										fee paid above the normal transactions fees. This levy fee can be assigned to be nem:xem (which is the mosaic notation for normal XEM coins) 
										or any other mosaic on the NEM blockchain. And lastly each mosaic gets a name that is under a unique domain in the Namespace system.</p><br>
										<p>Mosaic’s current version is a unique, advanced and customizable asset creation feature with later versions planned to carry even more 
										additional features. </p>
